        "\n",
        "- Complexity science emerged as a distinct field in the 1980s.\n",
        "- Its novelty lies not in studying new subjects, but in:\n",
        "  - Using different tools\n",
        "  - Allowing different kinds of scientific work\n",
        "  - Redefining what counts as “science”\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classical Science Example\n",
        "- Classical science often explains phenomena using:\n",
        "  - General laws\n",
        "  - Mathematical derivations\n",
        "  - Precise predictions\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  - Planetary orbits are explained using Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation.\n",
        "  - A differential equation is derived and solved, yielding elliptical orbits.\n",
        "- This type of explanation is considered rigorous and satisfying because:\n",
        "  - It resembles a mathematical proof.\n",
        "  - It explains a specific observation using a universal principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Complexity Science Example: Schelling’s Segregation Model\n",
        "- Thomas Schelling proposed a computational model to explain racial segregation in cities.\n",
        "- The model represents a city as a grid of houses:\n",
        "  - Houses are occupied by two types of agents (red and blue).\n",
        "  - Roughly equal numbers of each group.\n",
        "  - About 10% of houses are empty.\n",
        "- Agents evaluate happiness based on local neighbors:\n",
        "  - Happy if at least two neighbors are the same type.\n",
        "  - Unhappy if they have one or zero similar neighbors.\n",
        "- Simulation process:\n",
        "  - Randomly select an agent.\n",
        "  - If unhappy, the agent moves to a random empty house.\n",
        "- Results:\n",
        "  - Even from an initially unsegregated city, clusters form.\n",
        "  - Over time, large homogeneous neighborhoods emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation and Debate\n",
        "- The model suggests segregation can arise from mild individual preferences.\n",
        "- Many people find this explanation less satisfying than classical explanations because:\n",
        "  - The model is highly abstract.\n",
        "  - It lacks physical laws and mathematical derivations.\n",
        "  - It relies on simulation rather than proof.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparing the Two Approaches\n",
        "- Both classical and complexity models involve simplifications.\n",
        "- Differences:\n",
        "  - Planetary models justify simplifications by showing ignored forces are small.\n",
        "  - Social models like Schelling’s are harder to validate quantitatively.\n",
        "- Despite this, complexity models are valuable because they:\n",
        "  - Provide insight into emergent behavior.\n",
        "  - Support explanation, prediction, and design.\n",
        "- A key goal of complexity science is to show how such models can still do meaningful scientific work.\n"
