        "## What Are Agent-Based Models (ABMs)?\n",
        "- Models composed of **agents** that:\n",
        "  - Gather information\n",
        "  - Make decisions\n",
        "  - Take actions\n",
        "- Agents represent people or other decision-making entities\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Characteristics of Agents\n",
        "- Situated in **space or networks**\n",
        "- Interact **locally** with nearby agents\n",
        "- Have **imperfect or incomplete information**\n",
        "- Often **heterogeneous** (agents differ from one another)\n",
        "- Frequently include **randomness** in agents or environment\n",
        "\n",
        "## How ABMs Differ from Rule-Based Models\n",
        "- Earlier models: identical components + fixed rules\n",
        "- ABMs: diverse agents + adaptive, decision-driven behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Agent-Based Models Matter\n",
        "- Useful for studying **non-equilibrium dynamics**\n",
        "- Can also analyze **equilibrium behavior**\n",
        "- Help link:\n",
        "  - **Individual decisions**\n",
        "  - **Emergent system-level outcomes**\n",

        "- Proposed by **Thomas Schelling (1969)** in *“Models of Segregation”*\n",

        "## Model Setup\n",
        "- World is a **grid**\n",
        "  - Each cell = a **house**\n",
        "- Houses contain:\n",
        "  - **Red agents**\n",
        "  - **Blue agents**\n",
        "  - ~**10% empty houses**\n",
        "- Roughly equal numbers of red and blue agents\n",

        "- Each agent considers the **8 surrounding cells** (Moore neighborhood)\n",

        "## Agent Happiness Rule\n",
        "- Agent is **happy** if:\n",
        "  - At least **2 neighbors are like itself**\n",

        "- At each step:\n",
        "  - Pick a **random agent**\n",
        "  - If happy → **do nothing**\n",

        "- Strong segregation emerges even though:\n",
        "  - Agents are **not strongly biased**\n",
        "  - Agents are comfortable with **mixed neighborhoods**\n",
        "  - They only avoid being **heavily outnumbered**\n",

        "\n",
        "- Sugarscape is an **agent-based model** introduced in 1996 by Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell.\n",
        "- It was designed to study economics and social science questions using an “artificial society”.\n",
        "- The model is highly versatile and has been adapted for many research topics.\n",
        "- In its simplest form, Sugarscape represents a **simple economy**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Idea\n",
        "- Agents move on a **2-D grid**.\n",
        "- They collect and store “sugar”, which represents **economic wealth**.\n",
        "- Sugar availability varies across the grid.\n",
        "- Agents differ in their ability to find and consume sugar.\n",
        "- The model is often used to study **wealth distribution and inequality**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Grid Structure\n",
        "- Each grid cell has a **capacity**, the maximum sugar it can hold.\n",
        "- The original setup includes:\n",
        "  - Two high-sugar regions with capacity 4\n",
        "  - Surrounding concentric regions with capacities 3, 2, and 1\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agents\n",
        "- Initially, **400 agents** are placed randomly.\n",
        "- Each agent has three attributes:\n",
        "  - **Sugar**: Initial wealth between 5 and 25 units\n",
        "  - **Metabolism**: Sugar consumed per step (1–4 units)\n",
        "  - **Vision**: Distance the agent can see in each direction (1–6 cells)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agent Behavior (Per Time Step)\n",
        "- Agents act one at a time in random order.\n",
        "- Each agent:\n",
        "  - Scans cells in the four compass directions up to its vision range\n",
        "  - Chooses the unoccupied cell with the most sugar\n",
        "  - Breaks ties by choosing the closest cell, then randomly if needed\n",
        "  - Moves to the chosen cell and harvests its sugar\n",
        "  - Consumes sugar based on metabolism\n",
        "  - Dies (starves) if sugar drops below zero\n",
        "\n",
        "### Environment Dynamics\n",
        "- After all agents move:\n",
        "  - Cells regrow sugar, typically 1 unit per step\n",
        "  - Sugar growth is capped by each cell’s capacity\n",
        "\n",
        "### Emergent Behavior\n",
        "- Agents move toward high-sugar regions.\n",
        "- High-vision agents move faster and survive more easily.\n",
        "- Low-vision or high-metabolism agents are more likely to starve.\n",
        "- Initial population drops rapidly, then stabilizes around **250 agents**.\n",
        "- Surviving agents tend to accumulate large amounts of sugar indefinitely.\n",

        "  - Has an age that increases every time step\n",

        "- Sugarscape is not designed primarily to study movement patterns\n",
        "- However, agent migration produces **unexpected wave-like behavior**\n",
        "- These patterns emerge from local rules, not explicit coordination\n",
        "\n",
        "## Initial Setup\n",
        "- All agents start clustered in the **lower-left corner**\n",
        "- High-capacity sugar regions (“peaks”) are located elsewhere on the grid\n",
        "\n",
        "## Migration Dynamics\n",
        "- Agents move toward the nearest high-capacity sugar peak\n",
        "- If the number of agents exceeds what one peak can support:\n",
        "  - Sugar is quickly depleted\n",
        "  - Agents are forced into lower-capacity regions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Role of Vision\n",
        "- Agents with **longer vision** can:\n",
        "  - Cross low-sugar valleys between peaks\n",
        "  - Reach distant high-capacity regions sooner\n",
        "- These agents initiate movement toward the northeast\n",
        "\n",
        "## Wave Formation\n",
        "- Moving agents leave behind **stripes of empty cells**\n",
        "- Other agents cannot follow immediately because sugar is depleted\n",
        "- Once sugar regrows, new groups move forward\n",
        "- This creates **discrete waves of migration**\n",

        "## Wave Characteristics\n",
        "- Each wave behaves like a **coherent object**\n",
        "- Similar to:\n",

        "  - Moving patterns in the Game of Life\n",
